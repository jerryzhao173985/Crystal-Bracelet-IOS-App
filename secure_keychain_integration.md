The compiler error is simply that **`Data` lives in Foundation**, so the fix is to add a single import.  
Below is the corrected helper, followed by a concise note on why Keychain is still the right choice even on iOS 18, and a few optional refinements you can adopt.

## 1 · Corrected `KeychainHelper.swift`

```swift
import Foundation           // ← adds Data, UUID, etc.
import Security

/// Thin wrapper around keychain‑services for two secrets: DeepSeek & OpenAI.
final class KeychainHelper {
    static let shared = KeychainHelper()
    private init() {}

    private let service = "com.jerry.CrystalBraceletIOS"

    // MARK: – CRUD
    func save(_ value: String, for key: String) {
        let data = Data(value.utf8)                                // Data now resolves

        let query: [String:Any] = [ kSecClass as String: kSecClassGenericPassword,
                                    kSecAttrService as String: service,
                                    kSecAttrAccount as String: key ]

        let attrs = [kSecValueData as String: data]

        if SecItemCopyMatching(query as CFDictionary, nil) == errSecSuccess {
            SecItemUpdate(query as CFDictionary, attrs as CFDictionary)
        } else {
            var add = query; add[kSecValueData as String] = data
            SecItemAdd(add as CFDictionary, nil)
        }
    }

    func read(_ key: String) -> String? {
        let query: [String: Any] = [ kSecClass       as String: kSecClassGenericPassword,
                                     kSecAttrService as String: service,
                                     kSecAttrAccount as String: key,
                                     kSecReturnData  as String: true,
                                     kSecMatchLimit  as String: kSecMatchLimitOne ]

        var item: CFTypeRef?
        guard SecItemCopyMatching(query as CFDictionary, &item) == errSecSuccess,
              let data = item as? Data,                               // Data now resolves
              let str  = String(data: data, encoding: .utf8) else { return nil }
        return str
    }

    func delete(_ key: String) {
        let q: [String:Any] = [ kSecClass as String: kSecClassGenericPassword,
                                kSecAttrService as String: service,
                                kSecAttrAccount as String: key ]
        SecItemDelete(q as CFDictionary)
    }
}
```

*Nothing else in the project needs modification—`AnalysisViewModel` already loads/saves via this helper.*

## 2 · Why Keychain remains the right store on iOS 18

* iOS 18’s **new Passwords app** is a first‑party UI for credentials, but developer APIs are unchanged—you still use **Keychain Services** to store per‑app secrets. The Passwords UI does **not** surface generic‑password items saved under your private service name, so users won’t see (or accidentally delete) their DeepSeek/OpenAI tokens. citeturn0search2turn0search6  
* Keychain data is encrypted with the device passcode and synced through iCloud Keychain if the user opts in, meeting Apple’s latest privacy guidance. citeturn0search3turn0search0

## 3 · Optional enhancements enabled by iOS 18

| Enhancement | API / Rationale |
|-------------|-----------------|
| **Use Passcode‑gate** before revealing the key in the field <br>(`.privacySensitive()` + `focusedScene`) | iOS 18 extends privacy prompts; you can mark the SecureField as privacy‑sensitive so it’s redacted in screen recordings. citeturn0search10 |
| **Group‑keychain sharing** if you release a Mac‑companion app | Add an *access‑group* to the query so both apps see the token. citeturn0search1 |
| **Graceful deletion** | If the user blanks the field and taps Analyse, call `KeychainHelper.delete(_:)` so stale secrets don’t linger. |

These are drop‑in tweaks; no structural redesign required.

---

### Bottom line

Add `import Foundation` to the helper and the build error disappears.  
Keychain—backed by iOS 18’s security stack—remains the most common and recommended place to cache API tokens; the extra Passwords UI introduced in iOS 18 does not change that.


---

## Behaviour

* First launch: text boxes are empty → user enters keys → Analyse succeeds → keys stored.
* Next launch: deepseekKey / openaiKey load from Keychain and appear pre‑filled.
* User can overwrite or delete them at any time; the next successful Analyse overwrites the Keychain entry.

No other components are touched, so the UX remains identical—just without repetitive typing.
